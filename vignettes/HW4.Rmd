all your code should be visible in the knitted chunks.

- To complete this homework, you may write in the `HW3.Rmd` file. 
(It is recommended to complete this homework in R Studio, where clicking the
`Knit` button would knit your homework.)

# Disclosures

- Please disclose below who you collaborated with and if you've used ChatGPT (or any
comparable AI tool) to what extent when completing this homework. See the syllabus
for the course expectations.

# Note about the homework

**Note**: Most of your R code for this homework will **not** be in this homework.
You mainly write `.R` files inside the `R` or `tests` folders.
Therefore, you only need to show a little code inside this R Markdown file.
You only need to write things inside this R Markdown file in the questions that explicitly ask you to do so.

Please use [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-ZTDPp39zbhsKbQ2FfBoCtiXKQj0jQSg75MAatYfiGI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-ZTDPp39zbhsKbQ2FfBoCtiXKQj0jQSg75MAatYfiGI/edit?usp=sharing) as a resource for this homework.

# Code of conduct for this homework

<mark><u>**Please be respectful to your peers**</u></mark> for this homework. 
Each student's `compute_maximal_partial_clique()` function is anonymized and
being used by every other student for this homework. 
Some implementations of this function work smoother than others. 
Nonetheless, 1) please be respectful to all the implementations throughout this homework, as you might not realize you're talking to the author of an implementation, and 2) please do not feel embarrassed if you (knowing which implementation is yours, since you wrote it) does not work as well as you initially thought. Please do not try to "figure out" which student wrote which implementation.

I am <u>**overwhelmingly confident**</u> that you all wrote an implementation that suits your current comfort in R (which, of course, is different from student to student).

# Q1: Doing a code review of two other implementations

<u>**Question 1B**</u>: Looking at two implementations you were given, summarize what you think the implementations are doing in one to four sentences each. (This is to practice reading other people's code.)

#### First Implementation: `compute_maximal_partial_clique19`
The `compute_maximal_partial_clique19` function seeks to find the largest partial clique within an adjacency matrix that meets a specified edge density threshold, alpha. It uses a greedy approach by first ordering nodes based on their degree and then iteratively building cliques starting from the highest degree nodes. At each step, it adds nodes to the current clique if the resulting submatrix meets the required edge density. The function continues this process to find and return the clique with the highest density that meets the alpha threshold. This method prioritizes nodes with higher connectivity to quickly build dense cliques.

#### Second Implementation: `compute_maximal_partial_clique23`
The compute_maximal_partial_clique23 function aims to identify the largest partial clique in a given adjacency matrix that meets a specified edge density, alpha. The function first verifies the validity of the input matrix and alpha using various checks. It then uses a backtracking approach to explore potential cliques, starting from an empty set and iteratively adding nodes. During this process, it ensures that the current subset of nodes maintains the required edge density. The largest valid clique found is returned along with its edge density.

<u>**Question 1C**</u>
### Recommendations for Improving Code Clarity

#### First Implementation: `compute_maximal_partial_clique19`

1. **Documentation**: The function could benefit from more detailed comments explaining the logic within the loops. For example, explaining why `degrees` are used to order the nodes and what the `possible_edges` calculation represents would help others understand the thought process behind the approach.

2. **Modularization**: Similar to the first implementation, breaking down the main function into smaller helper functions could improve readability and maintainability. For instance, the part of the code that calculates `new_density` could be a separate function, enhancing clarity and enabling easier debugging.

#### Second Implementation: `compute_maximal_partial_clique23`

1. **Variable Naming**: The function uses variables such as `curr_vertex`, `curr_clique`, and `next_vertex` within the `find_maximal_clique` function. These names are clear, but could be more descriptive. For instance, `curr_vertex` could be renamed to `current_node` and `curr_clique` to `current_clique_nodes` to improve readability.

2. **Function Factorization**: The function `is_partial_clique` is nested within the main function. It might be beneficial to move this out as a standalone helper function. This separation can make the code modular and easier to test individual components.

# Q2: Constructing a simulation study

<mark>**Intent**: The intent of this question is to construct a simulation study that you'll run on Bayes.</mark>

In this question, you'll be designing a simulation. You will be doing this on Bayes for a couple of reasons: 1) To give you experience running code on Bayes, and 2) because your simulations might take a couple of hours to run.

Note: inside the file `compute_maximal_partial_clique_master.R` (which should now be in your `R` folder), I've provided you two functions: `compute_maximal_partial_clique_master()` and `compute_correct_density()`. You will find both functions useful for Q2 and Q3.

<u>**Question 2A**</u>: Please run the following code. If you cannot run it, something has gone wrong with your `UWBiost561` package. (For instance, it might be because your `generate_partial_clique()` function does not work or is not correctly located in your R package.)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(UWBiost561)
set.seed(10)
data <- UWBiost561::generate_partial_clique(n = 10, 
                                            clique_fraction = 0.5,
                                            clique_edge_density = 0.95)

set.seed(10)
result1 <- UWBiost561::compute_maximal_partial_clique_master(
  adj_mat = data$adj_mat, 
  alpha = 0.95, 
  number = 11, 
  time_limit = 10
)
result1

set.seed(10)
result2 <- UWBiost561::compute_maximal_partial_clique11(
  adj_mat = data$adj_mat, 
  alpha = 0.95
)
result2
```

As you can see, the `compute_maximal_partial_clique_master()` function: 1) takes a `number` argument (which allows you to control which implementation of `compute_maximal_partial_clique` you're using) and 2) sets a timer (here, of 30 seconds)
so that the function terminates in at most 30 seconds.

Using the provided code as a framework, use the `compute_maximal_partial_clique_master()` with a setting of `time_limit` such that the function terminates prematurely, i.e., `time_limit` is set to be a small number. (That is, if, hypothetically, the function required 40 seconds to complete, but you set `time_limit` to only be 30 seconds.) By changing the ' number ' argument, you can use any implementation of `compute_maximal_partial_clique` you prefer for this question.

Note: For this question, you want to generate an adjacency matrix where `n` is large (i.e., a value close to 50), but `time_limit` is very small (i.e., just a few seconds). You deliberately want to cause a `timed_out` status.

<u>**Question 2B**</u>: 
I am going to use the demo simulation showed during Lecture 8.

<u>**Question 2C**</u>: In your `R` folder, design a function that executes your intended simulation plan. (I am purposely being loose and very open-ended about designing this simulation regarding the inputs or outputs. In contrast to HW3, where everything was spelled out explicitly, I am now giving you the task of meaningfully designing the inputs/outputs.)

Note 1: You want to use `compute_maximal_partial_clique_master()` in your simulation. This would make your life easier when switching between different implementations. The main difficulties in this question are: 

- 1) How to extract and store the results of `compute_maximal_partial_clique_master()`
- 2) How do you decide what meaningful outputs your simulation function should return (for example, you probably don't need to return the `adj_mat` adjacency matrices themselves)? This will highly depend on what your simulation plan is trying to study!
- 3) How to handle the instances when `compute_maximal_partial_clique_master()`: A) times out, B) errors, or C) outputs an alleged `clique_idx` that is invalid because it doesn't form a partial clique with edge density `alpha` or larger.

Note 2: Be aware -- you should be a healthy skeptic when using other people's code in a simulation. Just because a method claims it found a partial clique, you should verify that it is indeed a partial clique with edge density larger than `alpha`. You might want to use the `compute_correct_density()` function provided in `compute_maximal_partial_clique_master.R`.

Note 3: I am asking you to make a <u>**function**</u> to perform your simulation (instead of just an R script) since I will be asking you to test your simulation function in Question 2D below.

Note 4: You should allow your simulation function to take as input the different levels of your simulation study and the number of trials (and other parameters of your choosing). That way, you can more easily "test" a "simple" simulation study in Question 2D below.

Note 5: You (ideally) want to set up your simulation such that for each trial in a level, you generate <u>**one**</u> random adjacency matrix that is used in <u>**all 25**</u> different implementations of `compute_maximal_partial_clique`. This gives a "fair" comparison across all 25 methods. You also might want to set the random seed (via `set.seed()`) before generating that random adjacency matrix for this trial so you can easily reproduce the results from a particular trial if needed.

Note 6: This question is the hardest part of HW4. Since this question is purposely more open-ended, it is harder to use ChatGPT to help you with this function. However, most of your future coding experiences will be open-ended, so practicing "coding with ChatGPT" in more unstructured settings is good. I encourage you to work with your classmates on this question (but, as per our syllabus rules, do not directly copy your classmate's code).

<span style="color: blue;">(There is nothing to report for this question. Your code will be in the `R` folder, **not**
in this R Markdown file.)</span>

<u>**Question 2D**</u>: Create a few (more than one) unit tests for your simulation function. This unit test (like your unit tests in HW3) will be in your `tests/testthat` folder. I am also purposely vague about how many tests or what kind of unit tests to write. This is for you to decide! After all, you're about to unleash your code to perform a (potentially long) simulation test, so you hope you've tested your simulation code well enough for this to be a good use of time.

Note: Your unit tests should be <u>**fast**</u> (i.e., take no more than a minute to run). This means your unit tests should <u>**not**</u> be performing your complete simulation study. After all, it'll be a useless unit test if it takes an hour to figure out if your unit test passed. However, you want your unit tests (which take less than a minute) to give you confidence that your code will work when running the complete simulation study (which might take more than an hour).

<span style="color: blue;">(There is nothing to report for this question. Your code will be in the `tests/testthat` folder, **not**
in this R Markdown file.)</span>

<u>**Question 2E**</u>: Similar to what you did in HW3, please include a screenshot of your output after running `devtools::check()`. You should still have a `UWBiost561` package
that passes all the checks and your unit tests.
(As a guideline, one screenshot should show the first 20-or-so lines of your 
`devtools::check()` results, and a second screenshot should show the last 
20-or-so lines of your results.) You can use the `knitr::include_graphics()` function to include
figures inside this R Markdown file.

The intent of this question is to provide "evidence" that your `devtools::check()`
went smoothly. You do not need to worry about what your screenshots show specifically.

# Q3: Performing the simulation study

<u>**Question 3E**</u>:
```{r check1, out.width = "400px", fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, fig.cap=c("The first screenshot you are trying to reproduce (without the Sample watermark) in Question 4C.")}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/SZ-yang/UWBiost561/blob/main/vignettes/hw4-demo_bayes_plot.png?raw=true")
```
